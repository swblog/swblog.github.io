# Home Depot(家得宝)'s Failure in China

## I. Introduction of Home Depot

Founded in 1978, Home Depot, Inc. is the world's largest home improvement specialty retailer, and the fourth-largest retailer in the United States. The company's fiscal 2010 retail sales were \$68.0 billion, and earnings from continuing operations were \$3.3 billion. Currently, the company has more than 2,200 retail stores in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands. The company was ranked No. 30 on the Fortune 500 list in 2010.

## II. China Experience

Home Depot entered China in 2006 by acquiring 12 stores from the Chinese home improvement company Home Way, China's first big-box(大卖场) home improvement retailer. 

In 2006, Home Depot employed 3,000 associates and operated 12 stores across six cities in China—Tianjin (5), Beijing (2), Xi'an (2), Qingdao (1), Shenyang (1), and Zhengzhou (1). Tianjin was the anchor city because it was the headquarters of Home Way. 

Home Depot China's store format was big-box operation, with an average of 90,000 square feet per store, based on a DIY model developed in the United States. The stores offer such services as delivery, installation, design, and remodeling. The Chinese translation for Home Depot is “Jia De Bao,” which literally means “getting treasures for your home”.

In May 2009 Home Depot suddenly closed its storefront in Qingdao. On September 15, 2012, the Wall Street Journal reported that Home Depot Inc. decided to close all seven of its remaining big-box stores in China and to pull out of China after six years of losses. Home Depot joins a growing list of American retailers who have stumbled in China. 

## III. Related Materials

The following are quoted from a research report.

(1) From 2006 to 2012, Home Depot applied its American DIY business model almost without modification to China: its stores were operated on a big-box format located mostly at the outskirts of Chinese cities; its display of store merchandise required customers with substantial knowledge for self-work; and its advertising format was mailing printed flyers to customers. 

(2) Home Depot should have identified contractors(装修承包商) as a key segment of market in China. Li, a retired military officer, was a regular customer at Home Depot. In 2010, Li paid 6,000 yuan ($909) to the Home Depot Beijing store for a bathtub and cupboard for her condo in Beijing. She said she did not like Home Depot's big-box superstore culture. “I think most Chinese prefer hiring a decoration company rather than going the do-it-yourself way … and shopping assistants here are not enthusiastic about giving advice as I need help to understand the differences among various brands. Most shop assistants only promote the brands that they are paid to represent.”

(3) Who are the target customers for Home Depot? The target customers for international retailers such as Home Depot are the new-generation urban dwellers in first- and second-tier cities. The Chinese middle class consumers are fond of Western name brands and luxury products. Home Depot should have redesigned its image and packaged its products and services that carry the cache of “luxury from America.”  

(4) Homes purchased in Chinese cities are primarily unfinished condos, and need to be completed by professionals, as a comprehensive project. Most customers do not do it themselves in terms of shopping for building materials and fixing up the condos. They want to hire others to complete their home improvement projects.

(5) The Chinese home-improvement market is heavily fragmented. The top three home improvement companies combined occupy only 3% of the total Chinese home improvement market. 

(6) There are many “gray areas” of doing business in China. As a US company bound by US laws, Home Depot cannot utilize the “gray channels” that Chinese firms use to secure government or business favors by paying them with fat gifts and commissions. 

(7) In Chinese home improvement stores, the price of virtually everything is up for negotiation between the seller and buyer on the spot, similar to a flea market. Most Chinese homeowners hire designers to shop for building materials. When designers buy tiles from a Chinese home improvement store, they receive cash bonuses on the spot. This is the system that Home Depot is up against in China, where business depends on “guanxi” (long-term reciprocal connections) and under-the-table commissions.

(8) Middle-class Chinese customers usually live in downtown areas in metropolitan Chinese cities. However, based on Home Depot's DIY model borrowed from the United States, Home Depot stores were located mostly in the suburbs, not in downtown. In Beijing, Home Depot had only one functional store in 2010 (this store was closed in January 2011). The store was on the fourth ring road, far away from the downtown, hidden behind trees. To drive from one end of the city to the other usually takes two to three hours in Beijing. Who would like to take a taxi for two to three hours to this one Home Depot store to buy a lightbulb?

(9) With such a limited number of stores (12 stores in four cities in 2006 and then 7 stores in three cities in 2011, and now all closed), the percentage of market share for Home Depot in China was negligible. As a result, suppliers were unwilling to strike deals, and thus Home Depot prices were not competitive for price-conscious Chinese customers. Many Chinese suppliers were aware of the fact that Home Depot was a Fortune 500 company, but when they compared Home Depot to its foreign and Chinese competitors in China regarding sales volume, they chose not to favor Home Depot.

(10) Labor is cheap in China. In a nation with a sizable pool of unskilled labor and countless small-time construction companies, it is simply more convenient and cheaper to outsource such manual labor jobs as home improvement. As a result, most Chinese consumers do not Do-It-Themselves on home improvement. They choose to hire contractors.

(11) In 1975, China adopted the “One Child Policy” as a national regulation for population control, with urban dwellers allowed only one child per couple. These only children, the “little emperors and empresses” of China, are now in their 20s, 30s, and approaching their 40s. They are the vital components of international retailers' target consumers in China. Most of these only children become homeowners when they get married, usually with financial contributions from their parents. These only children have been somewhat spoiled by their two parents and four grandparents, and have normally not done much manual labor work growing up in urban China.

## Answers

**Answer of Question 1** 

The case stresses the importance of host culture in creating a business model when an international retailer expands to a foreign country. Chinese middle-class consumers does not support Home Depot's DIY business model.

First, there is a “social status issue” concerning the DIY model. Since antiquity, manual labor has been looked down upon in China. Only lower-class citizens have to deal with manual labor. 

Consumers in China tend to trust Western brands more because there are so many counterfeits in China. However, Home Depot as a brand was basically unknown in China. Visiting China in August 2010, the author had great difficulty finding the Home Depot store in Beijing, and most taxi drivers had never heard of Home Depot.

**Answer of Question 2**

In 1998, IKEA started its retail operations in China. To meet local laws, it formed a joint venture. The venture served as a good platform to test the market, understand local needs, and adapt its strategies accordingly. It understood early on that Chinese apartments were small and customers required functional, modular solutions. The company made slight modifications to its furniture to meet local needs. The store layouts reflected the typical sizes of apartments and also included a balcony.

IKEA had faced similar problems previously when it entered the United States. The company initially tried to replicate its existing business model and products in the US. But it had to customize its products based on local needs. American customers, for instance, demanded bigger beds and bigger closets. IKEA had to make a number of changes to its marketing strategy in the US. The challenges it faced in China, however, were far bigger than the ones in the US.

As the company opened more stores from Beijing to Shanghai, the company's revenue grew rapidly. In 2004, for instance, its China revenue jumped 40 per cent from the year before. But there was a problem - its local stores were not profitable.

IKEA identified the strategic challenges and made attempts to overcome them. One of the main problems for IKEA was that its prices, considered low in Europe and North America, were higher than the average in China. Prices of furniture made by local stores were lower as they had access to cheaper labour and raw materials, and because their design costs were usually nil.

IKEA built a number of factories in China and increased local sourcing of materials. While globally 30 per cent of IKEA's range comes from China, about 65 per cent of the volume sales in the country come from local sourcing. These local factories resolved the problem of high import taxes in China. The company also started performing local quality inspections closer to manufacturing to save on repair costs.

Since 2000, IKEA has cut its prices by more than 60 per cent. For instance, the price of its "Lack" table has dropped to 39 yuan (less than five euros at current exchange rates) from 120 yuan when IKEA first came to the Chinese market. The company plans to reduce prices further, helped by mass production and trimming supply chain costs.

High prices were one of the biggest barriers in China for people to purchase IKEA products. IKEA's global branding that promises low prices did not work in China also because western products are seen as aspirational in Asian markets. In this regard, IKEA's low-price strategy seemed to create confusion among Chinese consumers.

The company realised this and started targeting the young middle-class population. This category of customers has relatively higher incomes, is better educated and is more aware of western styles. Targeting this segment helped IKEA project itself as an aspirational western brand. This was a massive change in strategy, as IKEA was targeting the mass market in other parts of the world.

IKEA also had to tweak its marketing strategy. In most markets, the company uses its product catalogue as a major marketing tool. In China, however, the catalogue provided opportunities for competitors to imitate the company's products. Indeed, local competitors copied IKEA's designs and then offered similar products at lower prices. IKEA decided not to react, as it realised Chinese laws were not strong enough to deter such activities. Instead, the company is using Chinese social media and micro-blogging website Weibo to target the urban youth.

IKEA also adjusted its store location strategy. In Europe and the US, where most customers use personal vehicles, IKEA stores are usually located in the suburbs. In China, however, most customers use public transportation. So the company set up its outlets on the outskirts of cities which are connected by rail and metro networks.

The China expansion came at a cost. Since 1999, IKEA has been working on becoming more eco-friendly. It has been charging for plastic bags, asking suppliers for green products, and increasing the use of renewable energy in its stores. All this proved difficult to implement in China. Price-sensitive Chinese consumers seem to be annoyed when asked to pay extra for plastic bags and they did not want to bring their own shopping bags. Also, a majority of suppliers in China did not have the necessary technologies to provide green products that met IKEA's standards. Helping them adopt new technologies meant higher cost, which would hurt business. IKEA decided to stick with low prices to remain in business.

**Answer of Question 3** 

Home Depot could have replaced its ineffective DIY (Do-It-Yourself) model with the new DIFM (Do-It-for-Me) business model for China.

The more practical Chinese business model for Home Depot is DIFM. DIFM is a customer-centered business model that combines products with services. In the DIFM model, Home Depot would provide “design and build service” in a package to customers, and the company would establish long-term relationships with consumers, contractors, and suppliers. The only major task the Chinese customer would need to do is to discuss with the Home Depot team what they want as the end product package.

Home ownership was almost nonexistent about 15 years ago in China. It was then very common for a family, sometimes three generations, to share a 300-square-foot room. Today, Chinese homeowners are eager to learn from the West about home improvement. This is one reason why IKEA is popular in China. Their Western-style showrooms provide model bedrooms, dining rooms, and family rooms. IKEA's stylish and functional modern furniture is particularly appealing to young couples (Wang, 2011). CELM analysis of the Chinese consumer culture demands that international retail stores such as Home Depot demonstrate strong design capability. A design center can function as an educational base for home improvement to the new generation of Chinese homeowners. In China, design services have boomed, accounting for one third of sales, and could provide a crucial advantage to Home Depot (CNN, 2010). In Shanghai, B&Q has developed a full-blown in-house design center. Homeowners can sit down with an interior decorator using a computer displaying three-dimensional images of their apartment. The decorator then hires contractors to install electrical outlets, bathroom plumbing, kitchen appliances, flooring, and almost everything else. The only requirement is that 80% of goods must be purchased through B&Q. In 2006 the company outfitted 30,000 apartments in China. To figure out the ever-evolving taste of Chinese consumers, B&Q relies on its 12,000 Chinese employees for insight. Informal chats in the stores, as well as staff meetings, help drive the latest intelligence up to the head office. The centers also offer free bus rides to B&Q stores in nearby cities so that customers can see fully built models of kitchens and bathrooms. “This is the first apartment they have owned,” Gliwinski says. “They need advice, and they need imagination. You need to let them see what a home looks like” (Warner, 2007). In a B&Q store in Shanghai, customers take photographs of the kitchen and bathroom mock-ups, jot down notes, and make shopping lists.

Home Depot was once experienced in design centers. In 1991, Home Depot established its first Expo Design Center in San Diego. The Expo Design Centers carried higher-end products and sold complete solutions to household needs, such as modular kitchens, assembled bathrooms, etc. In the mid-1990s, Home Depot collaborated with the Discovery Channel and Lynette Jennings on a home improvement program, called HouseSmart, which was televised daily (ICMR, 2004). Companies that invest in educating the market can expect to reap handsome rewards. An international retailer such as Home Depot can consider collaborating with a Chinese television station and creating an educational home improvement TV show to educate Chinese consumers. In addition, such TV shows will simultaneously promote the Home Depot brand.
